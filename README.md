# K-MEANS-CLUSTERING-IN-MALLCUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION
k-means algorithm is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data. It aims to partition a given dataset into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean value.With the mean value we use for model creation and performance evaluation.
